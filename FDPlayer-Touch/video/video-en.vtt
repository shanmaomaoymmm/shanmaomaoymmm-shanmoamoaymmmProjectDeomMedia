Song:hanser

Lyricist & Composer:Yunomi

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.650
Engine sound that seems to break

Four
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.650
Beyond the blue sea

Five
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.600
The passenger plane carrying the two

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.650
Dare to crash land

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.950
Swaying swaying lifeboat

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.300
Don't sink

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.000
I knocked up a wet skirt

Ten
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.900
Sandy beach spreading ocean

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.000
No fan if you play alone

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.100
Sunshine warm

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.000
Premonition of love that bounces to the heart

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.200
SOS to rescue team

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.300
I can't see the rescue yet

16
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.400
Two uninhabited islands

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.700
Holiday to spend forever

18
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.600
I want to dance with you

19
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.500
South island

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.400
Midsummer night

twenty one
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.200
I won't sleep until morning

twenty two
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000
For a ripe smell

twenty three
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700
Wrapped

twenty four
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.400
Dance floor One fruit

twenty five
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.500
I'm sure it's sweet

26
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.800
You cast a spell

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.900
Biting a dream

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.100
This heartbeat that seems to pop

29
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.150
The night sky echoes

30
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
To you back to back

31
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.300
Don't realize

32
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.600
One or two flowing stars

33
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.800
I am looking for

34
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.400
Please, so that it will arrive someday

35
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400
Moonlight that guides the two

36
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.600
I remember when I was little

37
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.550
I'm about to be swallowed by the darkness

38
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.550
Frightened Lonely Night

39
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.700
It doesn't have to be inevitable

40
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.000
You don't have to say forever

41
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.900
But hey God, only now

42
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.700
I want to monopolize

43
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.700
I want to dance with you

44
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700
South island

45
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.200
Midsummer night

46
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.100
I won't sleep until morning

47
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.000
Magic is not yet

48
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
in the process of

49
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.600
Dance floor One fruit

50
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm sure it's sweet

51
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You cast a spell

52
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.200
Biting a dream

53
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.200
Someday my love too

54
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.600
I'm sure it's over

55
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.600
Until the sun rises again

56
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.600
Let me dream
